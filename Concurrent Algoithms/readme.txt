Asynchronous Systems: CSE 535
Programming Concurrent Algorithms:

1) Lamport's fast mutual exclusion algorithm and (2) Lamport's bakery algorithm are implemented using python.
The driver program can be run using the following command:

python.exe main.py n m

where n is the number of processes and m is the number of requests.

There are two classes namely FastMutex and Bakery which handle each of the algorithms. 
The main function accepts command line arguments as the processes and requests from the user. For each request,
a random number is generated by making use of the randrange function in python. The fast and 
bakery functions are invoked to assign threads. Once thread.start is called, the threads start to handle the 
request. The run method is invoked which keeps running until all the requests are satisfied. 

Test Data:

python.exe main.py 2 4
